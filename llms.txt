# Swarm & Bee CRE

> AI-powered commercial real estate intelligence platform. One query, full intelligence package.

## What This Is

Swarm & Bee CRE is an autonomous commercial real estate intelligence platform that produces structured, schema-validated Intelligence Objects from natural language queries. It runs on Cloudflare Workers across 300+ edge cities using Qwen3-30B edge AI.

## Core Capabilities

- **Search Orchestrator**: Natural language query → heuristic parser (< 5ms) → 6 parallel subsystems → full intelligence package in < 2 seconds
- **19 Composable AI Skills**: broker_senior, broker_junior, intelligence_query, bookmaker, deal_tracker, developer, signal_scraper, investor, exchange_1031, market_report, lead_scorer, email_composer, comp_analyzer, rent_roll_analyzer, debt_analyzer, tax_assessor, site_selector, portfolio_optimizer, news_digest
- **50 State Area Experts**: Dedicated market intelligence for every US state
- **22 Event Types**: deal (6), supply (4), ownership (4), macro (4), tenant (4) — real-time CRE signal detection
- **Semantic Memory**: 768-dimensional vector embeddings with cosine similarity search
- **On-Chain Provenance**: Every Intelligence Object timestamped on Hedera Consensus Service (HCS-10 OpenConvAI)

## Intelligence Objects

A single query produces up to 7 object types:
1. **AssetIntelligenceObject** — property specs, lease terms, market rent
2. **MarketSnapshotObject** — rent range, vacancy, cap rates, heat score, infrastructure
3. **FinancialObject** — gross income, NOI, lease structure
4. **ValuationObject** — value range based on cap rate scenarios
5. **RiskFlagObject** — tenant concentration, insurance exposure, re-leasing risk
6. **AdvisoryObject** — investment profile, strength/risk scores, executive summary
7. **ActionPlanObject** — next steps and skills to execute
